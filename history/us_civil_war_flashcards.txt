# US Civil War History Flashcards

## Causes and Background

**Question: What were the primary causes of the American Civil War?**
**Answer:** 1) **Slavery** - The central issue: Southern states wanted to preserve slavery, Northern states opposed its expansion. 2) **States' Rights** - Dispute over federal vs. state authority, especially regarding slavery. 3) **Economic Differences** - Industrial North vs. Agricultural South. 4) **Westward Expansion** - Conflict over whether new states would allow slavery. 5) **Election of Lincoln** (1860) - Southern states seceded after his election.

**Question: When did the Civil War begin and what event started it?**
**Answer:** The war began on **April 12, 1861** when Confederate forces fired on **Fort Sumter** in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The Union garrison surrendered after 34 hours of bombardment. No lives were lost during the actual battle, but it marked the start of the bloodiest conflict in American history.

---

**Question: Which states seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy?**
**Answer:** Eleven states seceded: **South Carolina** (first, Dec 1860), **Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas** (before Fort Sumter), and **Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee** (after Fort Sumter).

**Question: What was the capital of the Confederacy?**
**Answer:** **Richmond, Virginia** (from May 1861). Originally, the Confederate capital was Montgomery, Alabama, but it moved to Richmond to be closer to the fighting and Virginia's industrial capacity. Richmond was located just 100 miles from Washington D.C., making the two capitals tantalizingly close.

---

**Question: What was the Anaconda Plan?**
**Answer:** The Union's strategic plan to defeat the Confederacy, proposed by General **Winfield Scott**. It involved: 1) **Naval blockade** of Southern ports to cut off trade, 2) **Control of the Mississippi River** to split the Confederacy in two, and 3) **Capture of Richmond**. Named for the anaconda snake that squeezes its prey to death. Took years to fully implement.

## Technology and Tactics

**Question: How did technology change warfare during the Civil War?**
**Answer:** First "modern" war: **Rifled muskets** (Minie ball) accurate to 500 yards vs. 100 for smoothbores. **Ironclad warships** (Monitor vs. Merrimac/Virginia 1862) made wooden navies obsolete. **Telegraph** enabled rapid communication. **Railroads** moved troops/supplies quickly. **Photography** brought war home (Mathew Brady). **Trench warfare** at Petersburg foreshadowed WWI. Yet tactics remained Napoleonic (massed infantry charges), causing high casualties.

---

**Question: What was the role of ironclad ships in the Civil War?**
**Answer:** First battle between ironclads: **USS Monitor** vs. **CSS Virginia** (formerly Merrimac) March 9, 1862 at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Neither ship could sink the other. Revolutionized naval warfare - wooden ships obsolete overnight. Union built "Monitor-class" ironclads to blockade Southern ports. Confederacy used ironclads to break blockades and defend rivers. First step toward modern steel warships.

---

**Question: How did the telegraph affect the Civil War?**
**Answer:** First war where commanders could communicate instantly over distance. Lincoln used **War Department Telegraph Office** (next to White House) to monitor battles and issue orders. More than 15,000 miles of telegraph wire strung by Union Army. Rapid communication of orders and intelligence. Created new military occupation: telegrapher. Confederacy lacked resources for extensive telegraph network.

---

**Question: What was the significance of railroads in the Civil War?**
**Answer:** First war where railroads were strategically crucial. **Confederacy** had less track (9,000 vs 22,000 miles), different gauge widths, and couldn't replace destroyed equipment. **Union** used railroads to move troops/supplies rapidly (11th and 12th Corps moved 1,200 miles in 11 days to Chattanooga 1863). Sherman's March targeted railroads to cripple Southern logistics.
